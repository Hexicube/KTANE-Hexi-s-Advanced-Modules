Requires merging with the KTANE modkit project, found here:

https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit/

This project only contains the assets and scripts for my mod.

Steps to merge:

1. Download ktane modkit repo.
2. Download this repo, and combine folders. This should ask if you want to merge the inner folders, "assets" and "manual".
3. Open the repo in unity, and it should be functional.

If there are compilation errors that reference the UnityEngine dll, close unity and delete the "library" folder.
